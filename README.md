# Calculator

Part of the Odin Project [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/). Uses Javascript (and JQuery), HTML, and CSS to implement a very basic calculator. Keyboard support is included: use the 'Esc' key to clear all; the 'Backspace' key to delete a digit; the 'Delete' key to clear the current entry; and the 'Enter' key as an equivalent for '='.
